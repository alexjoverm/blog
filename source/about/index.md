Hi there! I'm Alex Jover, a passionate FullStack developer from Spain. I co-organize [Alicante Frontend](https://www.meetup.com/Alicante-Frontend/) and participate at other [meetups and conferences]. You can find me [tweeting](https://twitter.com/alexjoverm), writting here or working on [open source side projects](https://github.com/alexjoverm).




I'm focused on all software craftmanship stuff, architecture, patterns, best practices and so. Although, when it comes to coding, I'm mainly focused on Javascript and all its ecosystem.
