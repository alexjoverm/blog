Here are my insights about organising Alicante Frontend's meetup after a year.

One year ago, [Aaron](https://twitter.com/aarongarciah), [Alvaro](https://twitter.com/AlvYuste) and I started this amazing ride together. It's been a year of meeting lots of people and having lots of fun. Satisfaction, success and happiness are the words that come to my mind when I think of [Alicante Frontend](http://alicantefrontend.es/).

We didn't know how it was going to work. Unlike bigger cities, Alicante didn't have much community. You could see cities around having communities and meetups with a stable 20-30 RSVP average. But we were decided to do it even though we didn't expect to have more than 20 people attending.

Nowadays, it's a pretty cool community that had a great variety of events, surpassing 100+ RSVP and having international events. We've had all kind of fun stuff, such as raffles and food&drinks networking. You can find us on the following channels:

- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/Alicante-Frontend)
- [Slack](http://alicantefrontend.herokuapp.com/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlicanteFront)

## What's Alicante Frontend made of?

First of all, we needed a **regular place** to host the events. We were lucky to find [ULab](https://ulab.es/), a co-working center that made everything easy for us from the beginning. Not only allowing us to use the space, but also helping us preparing and promoting them.

In ULab, **speakers** come and share whatever they'd like to. They're core of the events, and very, very difficult to find. That's why we like to compensate them for their effort. Lately we've been consistently having speakers every month, which is great.

Usually, we get to the events a bit sooner so we start preparing it. We try to make some fun so the speakers relax and feel more comfortable.

Then, an organizer gives a sync-up intro so we share some news, announcements, decisions or whatever that we have to for that month. We'd like to be as transparent as possible in order to keep the community informed.

We had talks about JavaScript, functional (reactive) programming, building projects, Web performance, Web analytics, and even a workshop of Clojure. Special thanks to [Flavio Corpa](https://twitter.com/FlavioCorpa), [Ciro Ivan](https://twitter.com/FlavioCorpa), [Kikobeats](https://twitter.com/kikobeats), [Joaquin](https://github.com/joakin), [Jose Manuel Perez](https://twitter.com/jmperezperez) and [Laura Bonmati](https://twitter.com/laurabonmati) for their talks and keeping this community alive.

In Alicante Frontend, we care about involving **companies**. We believe there is a need of improving the culture and mindset of local companies, and what's better than doing that starting from their people? We mentor each other on technologies, workflows and best practices. It's a win-to-win: companies get more visibility and qualified employees while employees feel more satisfied and productive by learning stuff and meeting people in the community.

Thanks to the companies that help us, we can do all kind of cool stuff that requires a minimum amount of costs: having stickers, presents for the speakers, meetup's costs...

And last but not least, Alicante Frontend is its **people**. We all come to teach, to learn, to share, and more importantly to **have fun**. That's community, doesn't matter how many you are, what matters is to enjoy meeting new people, talking about how your work is, what have you been doing lately and share experiences in general. We all are a big family.

Part of that happens in the **networking**, right after the event. Here we surely have fun.
